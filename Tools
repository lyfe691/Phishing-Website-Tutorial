In order for you to create the phishing you need to install nodejs! --> https://nodejs.org/en (LTS) <--
!When setting it up please checkmark!:
"Automatically install the necessary tools. Note that this will also install chocolately. The Script will pop up in a new window after the installation completes."
Additionally install git.
I also asume that you have installed python because it comes with the nodejs installer when you checkmark the box, incase you havent downloaded it please do so on the "python.org" website.
Great! after you've done that you need to enter this in your cmd/powershell whatever (i recommend using your terminal and not your raw cmd or powershell cuz you need 2 tabs open):


npm install nodemailer
npm install express
npm install cors
npm install express body-parser nodemailer cors


cool, after youve done that just, again, make sure that you have python installed! to test that just type "python" in your cmd. its important!
Youre done here, please move on to the "setup".
also make sure you have a editor installed i recommend visual studio code.
